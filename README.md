# GeCoUSB

Generators of knowledge, or "GECO" by its acronym in spanish,
is a student group that does life in the Simón Bolívar University in Caracas
, Venezuela.
It's main objective is to facilitate and contribute to the implementation of
spaces where integral academic content can be generated within the university for
the undergraduate level students.

Therefore, it is an organisation for the support and development of students of the
Simón Bolívar University, through the generation and compilation of study content
in different areas. It also seeks to maintains and improve knowledge already acquired
by students in various areas of interest.

The spaces of generation of critical content of the Venezuelan universities have been
declining due to the great political turmoil that has development in the recent years;
therefore, it is necessary to generate a proposal wherever the university that is
responsible for developing information relevant to the growth of the country.
GECO, seeks to be that proposal.

GECO website has been in operation for a couple of years at [Geco](http://gecousb.com.ve/) developed in Wordpress . The current project seeks to make the website of the student group independent from Wordpress it in order to not only keep its current platform but to growth and expand its services to Venezuelan undergraduate students.

## MVP

At first the MVP of this project is settle on avoiding feature regression, so the application needs to do the following:

```

As a student,
so I can study my courses,
I want to find the resources provided by the university community.

As a student,
so I can join GECO,
I want to find information about the student group, members, and projects.

As a student,
so I can assist to teacher assistant's classes
I want to find out information about the term schedules.

As a student,
so I can find out about the lastest updates in the student group on the website,
I want to see the twitter feed on the website.
```

Later on, the project involves giving a platform to teacher's assistant

```
As a teacher's assistant,
So I can give content to my students to study
I want to be able to upload new posts with content related to the website.

```
